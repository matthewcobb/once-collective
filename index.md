### **We create your north star**

**For your vision**

**For your team**

**For your tribe**

# We are here to revive our collective imagination

Once Collective creates concept films that show the world your vision, mission and essence.

When you align with a wider audience on your goal, you can go there together.

### **A new type of organisation for a new kind of future.**

**We are a trust network of purpose driven freelancers that share everything.**

* needs and opportunities
* networks and experience
* goals and ambitions
* talents and skills
* knowledge and ideas
* our stories and our selves

We specialise in videos condensing broad brands, organisations or ideas into digestable concepts.   
We know **branding** for audiences, **marketing strategy, film production**, **photography**, **motion graphics and VFX**.   
  
Based on the needs of the project our network of trusted partners and freelancers can expand into the surrounding fields of: 

* **ad marketing**
* **photography**
* **social media** **management**
* **written content**
* **web development** 
* **event experiences**
* **brand identity**
* **graphic design**

**Flexible but Assured** : Freelancers stake their reputation on new members. Members rely on each-other, so you can rely on them. 

**Full Discovery** : With deep brand and content strategy our solutions are based on the true fundamental problem at hand.

**Team Curation:** We work on longer prep times to book out the perfect team for the project. 

### We stand against a wasteful world

Our philosophy is built around openness and collaboration in the pursuit of new visions. Making the most of knowledge, skills, time and potential to be truly effective. 

This extends to our video production where shoots are broken down into smaller and repurposed pieces of content that weave multiple outlets and narratives together into coherent campaigns. 

The team is backed up by the wider network for consultation so any cross-discipline project is supported with expert, specialist insight. 

**We give our members 3 things: FREEDOM, COMMUNITY and PURPOSE.**

#### Freedom

**Through a custom, sustainable, freelance lifestyle. Projects that compound.**

* We provide consistent streams of work opportunities for our freelancers. When we ask they come. But we promote the lifestyle they seek.
* We create shared frameworks so nothing is done twice.  Bringing organisation and automation to where our members need it most.
* Shared risk in projects supported by the collective give members ownership of the work they do. We, together, invest in what speaks to us. 

#### Community

* We pair our community to others on similar paths and provide a supportive network to achieve their goals. 
* Sharing and contribution to each-others projects builds social capital and a culture of gratitude and generosity collectively. 
* Physical hubs for co-working, exclusive events, festivals. We connect in the physical. Share in the digital. Work in both. 

#### Purpose 

* The collective guides members towards their goals and aligns them towards projects that support their development. 
* Talents and interests can be explored through contribution that builds social capitol. Redeemable when you find that true calling. 
* Creativity and ideas flow through the network with a pool of shared insights with tools for implementation at your fingertips.
