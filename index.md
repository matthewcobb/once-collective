### **We create your north star**

**For your vision**

**For your team**

**For your tribe**

# We are here to revive our collective imagination

Once Collective creates concept films that show the world your vision, mission and essence.

When you align with a wider audience on your goal, you can go there together.

### **A new type of organisation for a new kind of future.**

**We are a network of purpose driven freelancers that share everything.**

* needs and opportunities
* networks and experience
* goals and ambitions
* talents and skills
* knowledge and ideas
* our stories and our selves

We specialise in videos condensing broad brands into digestable concepts. We know **branding** for audiences, **marketing strategy, film production**, **photography**, **motion graphics and VFX**.   
  
Our network of partners and freelancers can expand from this into surrounding fields for: 

* **ad marketing**
* **photography**
* **social media** **management**
* **written content**
* **web development** 
* **event experiences**
* **brand identity**
* **graphic design**

With deep brand and content strategy our solutions are based on the true fundamentals from initial exploration. 

We work on longer prep times to book out the perfect team for the project. Giving ample time to explore the brand and ideas. 

### Content for a new landscape

We take elements of psychology, emerging technologies and the latest marketing strategies to inform our process for creating new content.

Our concept films bridge the gap from imagination to reality.

**We give our members 3 things: FREEDOM, COMMUNITY and PURPOSE.**

#### Freedom

**Through a custom, sustainable, freelance lifestyle. Projects that compound.**

* We provide consistent streams of work opportunities for our freelancers. When we ask they come. But we promote the lifestyle they seek.
* We create shared frameworks so nothing is done twice.  Bringing organisation and automation to where our members need it most.
* Shared risk in projects supported by the collective give members ownership of the work they do. We together invest in what speaks to us. 

#### Community

* 

#### Purpose 

* The structure of the Collective guides members towards their purpose through a sharing economy and support structure to achieve their goals.

Honest feedback throughout our process keeps everyone on the path to higher collaboration.
