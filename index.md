### **We create your north star**

> **For your vision**
>
> **For your team**
>
> **For your tribe**

Once Collective creates concept films that show the world your vision, mission and essence.

When you align with a wider audience on your goal, you can go there together.

> **Concept films are short, sharable videos that encapsulate an organisation, mission or idea.**

### We use video to condense broad organisations, brands or ideas into digestible, interactive concepts.

##### We know branding for audiences, marketing strategy, film production, photography, motion graphics and VFX.

Based on the needs of the project our network of trusted partners and freelancers can expand into the surrounding fields of:

* **ad marketing**
* **photography**
* **social media** **management**
* **written content**
* **web development**
* **event experiences**
* **brand identity**
* **graphic design**

**Flexible but Assured** : Freelancers stake their reputation on new members. Members rely on each-other, so you can rely on them.

**Full Discovery** : With deep brand and content strategy our solutions are based on the true fundamental problem at hand.

**Team Curation:** We work on longer prep times to book out the perfect team for the project.

### **A new type of organisation for the future we need.**

**We are a trust network of purpose driven freelancers that share everything:**

* needs and opportunities
* networks and experience
* goals and ambitions
* talents and skills
* knowledge and ideas
* our stories and ourselves

Through Once our members are enabled to create a life of **Freedom**, **Community** and **Purpose**. 

We do this by providing sovereignty in a **mental**, **physical**, **social** and **digital sense**.
