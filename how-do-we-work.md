### We stand against a wasteful world

Our philosophy is built around openness and collaboration in the pursuit of new visions. Making the most of knowledge, skills, time and potential to be truly effective.

This extends to our video production where shoots are broken down into subsequent remixed content that weave multiple platforms and narratives together into coherent campaigns.

The team is backed up by the wider network for consultation so any cross-discipline project is supported with expert, specialist insight.

**We give our members 3 things: FREEDOM, COMMUNITY and PURPOSE.**

#### Freedom

**Through a custom, sustainable, freelance lifestyle. With projects that compound.**

* We provide consistent streams of work opportunities for our freelancers. They give loyalty to our projects and we promote the lifestyle they seek.
* We create shared frameworks so nothing is done twice.  Bringing organisation and automation to where our members need it most.
* Shared risk in projects supported by the collective gives members ownership of the work they do. We invest in each-other and whatever speaks to us all. 

#### Community

* We pair our community to other members on similar paths and provide a supportive network to achieve their goals.
* Sharing and contribution to each-others projects builds social capital and a culture of gratitude and generosity collectively.
* Online events, physical hubs for co-working, exclusive co-living events and festivals are all ways we connect. 
* A shared resource pool from contributors allows for a more curated environment of content based on personal intentions and interests. 

#### Purpose

* The collective guides members towards their goals and aligns them towards projects that support their development.
* Talents and interests can be explored through project contribution that builds social capitol in the network. Redeemable for support on your projects when you find that true calling.
* Creativity and ideas flow through the network with a pool of shared insights with tools for implementation at your fingertips.
