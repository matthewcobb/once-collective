### We stand against a wasteful world

Our philosophy is built around openness and collaboration in the pursuit of new visions. Making the most of knowledge, skills, time and potential to be truly effective.

This extends to our video production where shoots are broken down into smaller and repurposed pieces of content that weave multiple outlets and narratives together into coherent campaigns.

The team is backed up by the wider network for consultation so any cross-discipline project is supported with expert, specialist insight.

**We give our members 3 things: FREEDOM, COMMUNITY and PURPOSE.**

#### Freedom

**Through a custom, sustainable, freelance lifestyle. Projects that compound.**

* We provide consistent streams of work opportunities for our freelancers. When we ask they come. But we promote the lifestyle they seek.
* We create shared frameworks so nothing is done twice.  Bringing organisation and automation to where our members need it most.
* Shared risk in projects supported by the collective give members ownership of the work they do. We, together, invest in what speaks to us.

#### Community

* We pair our community to others on similar paths and provide a supportive network to achieve their goals.
* Sharing and contribution to each-others projects builds social capital and a culture of gratitude and generosity collectively.
* Physical hubs for co-working, exclusive events, festivals. We connect in the physical. Share in the digital. Work in both.

#### Purpose

* The collective guides members towards their goals and aligns them towards projects that support their development.
* Talents and interests can be explored through contribution that builds social capitol. Redeemable when you find that true calling.
* Creativity and ideas flow through the network with a pool of shared insights with tools for implementation at your fingertips.
